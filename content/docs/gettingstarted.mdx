## Installing Flutcn-ui

To install Flutcn-ui, add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutcn_ui: ^1.0.0
```

## Using Flutcn-ui

Once you have installed Flutcn-ui, you can start using its widgets in your Flutter app. Here's an example of how to use the FlutcnButton widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutcn_ui/flutcn_ui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutcn-ui Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: FlutcnButton(
            onPressed: () {},
            child: Text('Hello flutcn-ui'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the FlutcnButton widget from the flutcn_ui package and use it in our app. The FlutcnButton widget is a beautiful button that you can customize with various properties, such as its color, size, and shape.

## Customizing Flutcn-ui

Flutcn-ui is highly customizable, allowing you to create your own unique button designs. Here's an example of how to customize the FlutcnButton widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutcn_ui/flutcn_ui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutcn-ui Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: FlutcnButton(
            onPressed: () {},
            child: Text('Hello flutcn-ui'),
            style: FlutcnButtonStyle(
              backgroundColor: Colors.purple,
              foregroundColor: Colors.white,
              padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(
                horizontal: 24,
                vertical: 12,
              ),
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
