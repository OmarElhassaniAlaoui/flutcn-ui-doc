```

## Using Flutcn-ui

To start using Flutcn, install the CLI tool:

```sh
dart pub global activate flutcn_ui
``` 

setup ```flutcn_ui``` in your project using:
```bash 
flutcn init
```
that will ask to choose the path where flutcn can create the widgets and themes, and will create a ```flutcn.config.js``` file in the root of your project.

```bash 
flutcn init
Which path do you choose for theme ? (lib/themes)
Which path do you choose for widgets ? (lib/widgets)
Which style do you want to use? (new-york | default)
Which color scheme do you want to use? (zinc)
```
<Callout className="bg-blue-50 border-blue-600 dark:border-blue-900 dark:bg-blue-950 mb-6 [&_code]:bg-blue-100 dark:[&_code]:bg-blue-900">
  **Note:** themes and widgets folders should be in the same location.
</Callout>

Then, install a widget using:

```sh
flutcn add <widget-name>
```
